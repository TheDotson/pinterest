This project tasked us with creating a stripped down version of Pinterest where a user could add boards and pin; similar to the actual site.

## Instructions
You can create a new board and pins with the push of a button.  The links on the pins open in a new tab (depending on local settings) and you can move the pins between boards if you know the board id.
